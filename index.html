        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>Johnson was born Malcolm Michaels Jr. on August 24, 1945, in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Michaels had six siblings and a father, Malcolm Michaels Sr., who was an assembly line worker at General Motors. Michaels' mother, Alberta Claiborne, was a housekeeper. They attended an African Methodist Episcopal Church during Michaels'/Johnson's childhood and remained devoutly religious in later life, often taking an interest in Catholicism, but also making offerings to the saints in a personal manner, keeping a private altar at home.Johnson first began wearing dresses at the age of five but stopped temporarily due to harassment by boys who lived nearby. In a 1992 interview, Johnson described being the young victim of sexual assault by an adolescent boy. After this, Johnson described the idea of being gay as "some sort of dream", rather than something that seemed possible, and so chose to remain sexually inactive until leaving for New York City at 17.Johnson's mother reportedly said that being homosexual is like being "lower than a dog", but Johnson said that Alberta was unaware of the LGBT community. After graduating from Edison High School (now the Thomas A. Edison Career and Technical Academy) in Elizabeth in 1963, Johnson left home for New York City with $15 and a bag of clothes. Johnson waited on tables after moving to Greenwich Village in 1966.After meeting gay people in the city, Johnson finally felt it was possible to be gay and was able to come out.</p>

        <h3>Marsha the Drag Queen</h3>
        <p>During her adult years, Marsha performed as a drag queen under the name "Black Marsha." She eventually changed it to "Marsha P. Johnson," stating that the "P" stood for "pay it no mind," which was the answer she would often give when asked about her gender identity.</p>

        <p>Whenever she was asked where she landed on the spectrum of gender identity and sexuality, she would state that she was 'gay,' a 'transvestite,' or as a queen (referring to a drag queen). Marsha's style of drag was not serious, as she could not afford to purchase a wardrobe from expensive clothing stores. However, she was often seen wearing flowers in her hair and donning long robes or shiny dresses.</p>

        <p>She sang with the Hot Peaches - an international drag performance troupe- in 1972, and later on went to perform with The Angels of Light.</p>

        <h3>Stonewall</h3>
        <p>The Stonewall Inn was previously a bar that only welcomed gay men, but eventually became welcoming to women as well as drag queens. On the morning of June 28, 1969, the police began to perform a raid of the bar. This was common of law enforcement, as it was illegal in these times for individuals to dress outside of their biological gender. And gay and trans-inclusive spaces were prime targets for arrests.</p>
        <p>The uprising occurred began around 1:20 that morning, and Marsha reported that she had not arrive until the next hour around 2am. However, she was a very prominent figure during the two-day long riot. She was cited to have thrown a shot glass at the bar as it was lit on fire by the officers shouting: "I got my civil rights". It was also reported that she climbed atop a lamppost and dropped some sort of heavy object onto the windshield of a police cruiser on the second day of the riots.</p>

        <h3>After Stonewall: Activism</h3>
        <p>Following the aftermath of the Riots, Marsha decided to join the Gay Liberation Front, and participated in the first Christopher Street Liberation Pride rally on the first anniversary of Stonewall - often cited as the first Pride event.</p>

        <p>In 1972, Johnson and a close friend (Sylvia Rivera) founded the STARhouse, and sheltered many gay and trans street kids. Marsha was often referred to as the "drag mother" of the household, providing food and clothing for the children, and paying for rent with the money the all made as sex workers. The mission of the STAR house did not last very long, but served as an important model for a multitutde of gay and trans-friendly shelters that exist today.</p>

        <h3>Marsha's Health</h3>
        <p>By the time the 60's came around, Johnson was homeless and engaged in sex work as a method of survival. She had been arrested numberous times due to her ties to prostitution. She allegedly had her first mental breakdown in 1970 and would walk naked up and down Christopher Street in New York until she was taken away for a few months at a time to be treated with chlorpromazine, an antipsychotic. By the time she would get back from treatment, the medication would wear off after a month, and she would return to normal.</p>
        
        <p>From 1980 to 1992, Johnson's roomate - Randy Wicker - reported that Johnson's male persona "Malcolm" would sometimes come out. He recalled Malcolm being aggressive, speaking in a deeper voice, and actively looking to get into fights with others. Due to Marsha's volatile personality, she was banned from multiple gay bars across the city.</p>
        
        <p>Shortly after the Pride parade that occurred in 1992, Marsha's body was found floating in the Hudson River. Police intially ruled her death as a suicide, however her friends contested the notion, stating that Marsha was not suicidal, and that the back of Johnson's head looked like it suffered a major blow. Several people came to Marsha's defense and stated that they had seen a group of "thugs" fighting with Johnson on the night of July 4, 1992. The witness also stated that one of them used a homophobic slur and bragged later on that they had killed a drag queen named Marsha, however during that time, police officials could not be bothered with the death of a drag queen and did not continue to investigate.</p>
        
        <p>Eventually, Johnson was cremated and her ashes were released over the river by her friends after a funeral that was held at a local church.</p>
